                  character and the protagonist of The Witcher series of short

                  Yennefer (b. 1192) was a sorceress from Vengerberg, the
                  capital city of Aedirn, before being recruited by Tissaia de
                  Vries and brought to Aretuza to study magic. More than 30
                  years after her Ascension, she met Geralt of Rivia, whom she
                  had mixed feelings for due to the circumstances of how they
                  met.
